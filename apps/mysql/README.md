# MySQL Hypersync App Sample
This custom Hypersync app sample allows you to connect to a MySQL database server and extract user and database information.  It can be easily extended to retrieve additional information from MySQL.

## On Premise / Firewall Considerations
If your MySQL server lives on premise and/or behind a firewall, you may need to allow access from the IP address associated with deployed Hypersync app.  See the [SDK Documentation](https://github.com/Hyperproof/hypersync-sdk/blob/main/doc/00-toc.md) for more information on whitelisting the IP address.
