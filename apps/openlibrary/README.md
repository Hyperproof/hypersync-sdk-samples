# Open Library Sample App

The Open Library sample retrieves data from the REST API provided by [Open Library.org](https://openlibrary.org/). It is a good sample to examine if you would like to learn more about using REST APIs in a Hypersync.

## Authentication

The Open Library API is public--no authentication is required. As such there is no need to provide credentials when establishing a new connection.
